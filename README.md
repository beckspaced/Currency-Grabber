# Currency-Grabber
Grab daily currency exchange rates

A tiny script to grab daily currency exchange rates.
currently it uses http://www.xe.com/currencytables/ to grap the daily currency rates
in the past it used https://www.oanda.com/ as source but they changed their format a while ago and i was too lazy to find out what has changed ;)

the script is run daily via cronjob, e.g.

0 6 * * * /path/to/currency-grabber.php

the data is stored in the database. the storage tables can be created via script in /mysql/createTable.php

have a look in the source code on how to set the $currency to create the necessary tables to store the exchange rates

the script requires some PEAR libraries:
- Benchmark (https://pear.php.net/package/Benchmark)
- DB (https://pear.php.net/package/DB)
 
the script also makes us of PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser to parse the table with the currency rates.

all is BETA status and if you have any questions then please ask

thanks to all the external library devs & greetings
